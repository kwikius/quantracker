video analog input setup now done in lib

Fri Jul  3 10:53:57 BST 2015
Devel large mods to libraries to make it easier to create a custom app.
(breaking change so need to rebuild static libs)
Some shuffling of objects to try to prevent unresolved external symbol errors
Fixed issue with not being able to use spaces in setting vector flash values
(needs quan-trunk version > 1-0-4)

Wed 01 Jul 2015 09:01:22 BST 
Modify Telemetry functions. see the telemetry docs for info. Not backward compatible

Sun Jun 28 14:19:23 BST 2015
Split out system parts of quantracker_air_osd[_rx | _tx]
to a separate quantracker_air system lib

Sat Jun 27 10:36:45 BST 2015
Update builds of osd static libraries. Libraries are output to quantracker/libs/ subdir 
and objects now put in separate obj dir subdir of whichever src dir
Some work on Docs

Sat Apr 11 22:45:36 BST 2015
Errata. The DAC output pins on the OSD board have switched channels between V1 and V2 PCB.
(Looks like a slip up in the hierarchical labelling)

Mon Mar 30 08:10:16 BST 2015 : devel
Moved flash symbol table out of library code into user space so it
is now easy to create a custom flash symbol table. 
See /quantracker/examples/osd_example1/common/flash.cpp for details

Sat Mar 14 09:28:44 GMT 2015 : devel
New PCB V2.0 and V2.1 board on order to OSHPark. They are intended to be free of the GPS interference issues.
Looking at implementing flash vars in osd next

Sat Mar 14 14:39:05 GMT 2015
Moved Ground tracker flash stuff from local into quan/stm32/flash

Thu Mar  5 12:39:12 GMT 2015
OSD - Added some docs on bitmaps and an example to output a bitmap to stdout, to easily test bitmaps

Fri Feb 27 11:50:17 GMT 2015
OSD - In examples/osd_example1
   startup gps info,
   compass with home_arrow
   Artificial horizon in pitch and roll, 
   distance to home, 
   altitude now working
Compilation of quan/air/osd/Makefile Requires the quan library :
   version quan-1-0-2 available from http://www.github/kwikius/quan-trunk/


Wed Feb 25 18:02:45 GMT 2015
OSD Now working with PAL and NTSC. Will switch dynamically.
Added a get_video_mode function in the quan::uav::osd::api

Wed Feb 11 12:55:29 GMT 2015 : 
Change to non-interlaced for display so now around 360 x288. Uses 1/4 as much ram, 
which means much more available to user and other yet too be defined tasks. 
Maybe will revisit interlaced at some point, but currently prefer the freedom of 
extra memory.
Compilation of quan/air/osd/Makefile Requires the quan library :
   version quan-1-0-1 available from http://www.github/kwikius/quan-trunk/

Tue Feb 10 11:47:26 GMT 2015 : devel
added OSD Example in quantracker/examples/osd_example1
quan/air/osd/Makefile now builds this example
Added customisation info to Sample-Dependencies.mk.
Now by providing a list of deps in Dependencies.mk, should be able to make a custom version.
See Sample-Dependencies.mk for more details
(Hope to make a library eventually so this is a crude first step)

Also added a "make upload_sp" comand to invoke stm32flash to upload via serial port
(defaults to /dev/ttyUSB0)
-------------------------------------------------
18th July 2013
   I have moved the code and Makefile for the ground part of the tracker into the subdirectory ground/tracker/v1/
   as a prelude to moving all the other associated github projects into subdirectories of this project
   so that there will only be one Github project active.
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------
17th July 2013 
   Changed to using the gcc_arm_embedded arm gcc compiler toolchain from the Michael Pratt one. 
   Though the resulting binary image is much larger than previously, I hope that is down to inexperience. 
   There are other link options, for example, a "nano" version of newlib, which I havent yet tested.
